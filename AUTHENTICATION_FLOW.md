# Authentication Flow Summary

## Fixed Authentication System ✅

### Flow Overview
1. **Main Page (/)**: 
   - Shows login form if not authenticated
   - Redirects to `/dashboard` if already authenticated

2. **Login Page (/auth/login)**: 
   - Comprehensive login/signup form
   - After successful login, redirects to `/dashboard`
   - Supports demo accounts: admin/admin123, doctor/doctor123, assistant/assist123

3. **Dashboard (/dashboard)**:
   - Protected route - requires authentication
   - Shows full dashboard with patient management, exercises, etc.
   - Redirects to `/` (login) if not authenticated

### Demo Credentials
- **Admin**: username: `admin`, password: `admin123`
- **Doctor**: username: `doctor`, password: `doctor123`  
- **Assistant**: username: `assistant`, password: `assist123`

### How to Test
1. Visit the main page `/` - should show login form
2. Try logging in with demo credentials
3. Should redirect to `/dashboard` on success
4. Try logging out - should redirect back to login
5. Try accessing `/dashboard` directly without login - should redirect to login

### Files Modified
- `app/page.tsx` - Main page with auth check
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Dashboard moved to separate route
- `app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Updated redirect to /dashboard
- `components/auth-context.tsx` - Updated logout redirect
- `components/dashboard-layout.tsx` - Updated navigation links

The authentication system is now working properly with the correct flow!
